# to-do website
my personal website to create to-do lists (both daily and weekly) with an embedded Spotify playlist. 

**how to open file**

1. download ZIP file.
2. open from 'downloads'.
3. files can be opened by right-clicking and selecting to "open in Google Chrome" to view. (*Note: this was only tested on Mac/Macbook)
4. file should be viewable in web browser. 
 
*Please also note that the only pages created for the website so far are the "index.html" (landing page) and "daily page.html" files. When opening, **open via Google Chrome only**. These files are  only viewable when opened in a Google Chrome web browser and will **not** look the way it was intended to appear on any other browser or application.
